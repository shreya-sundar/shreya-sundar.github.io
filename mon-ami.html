                    <p>Mon Ami is an app that aims to support individuals that need an easy, free, and accessible platform to support them in times of stress and need. This project is done by the <span>Creative Tech Design Outreach Team</span> at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>

                <p>Life can be very stressful. From working professionals to busy students, we often forget to value ourselves and take care of our mental and physical health. The increase in mindfulness apps geared towards addressing individual struggles are a major step in providing relief. However, many of these products are often expensive, lack variety in content, and are often intended for solo use. How can we address and solve these shortcomings?</p>

This platform also incorporates a community feature to allow users to form meaningful and <span>supportive connections</span> with others.</p>

                <p>As we were getting started with the project, we <span>interviewed</span> some potential users about their experiences using mental health focused apps. The people we interviewed were generally college to young adult aged individuals who regularly use or have used mindfulness apps. We took note of their experiences with the usability of various meditation and mental health focused apps (navigability, interaction, flow, and intuitiveness). We also asked their opinions and preferences of existing features as well as what features they would like to see more of.</p>

                <h2>Usability Test #1</h2>
                <p>Recognizing the importance of <span>user research</span> in the UX process, we wanted to see how our product would be used amongst real users, and figure out improvements or additions we would need to make. We tested our prototype on potential users who fit our targeted audience. We recruited high school to college aged individuals to interview over Zoom, and had them perform tasks on the Mon Ami low fidelity prototype. We also had our users complete a consent form as well as a post study evaluation form.</p>
                <h4>Goal</h4>
                <p>To understand the user's <span>overall impression</span> of the low fidelity Mon Ami platform, and attain feedback and insights.</p>
                <h4>User Tasks</h4>
                <p>We designated 5 tasks as the most critical tasks for the users to accomplish: <br>
                <span>1.</span> Completing the daily check in <br>
                <span>2.</span> Navigating to the music page and liking a song <br>
                <span>3.</span> Finding and joining a specific community <br>
                <span>4.</span> Creating a post on the community page <br>

                <p>For the most part, our participants were able to <span>complete the tasks</span>, and reported the tasks as being fairly simple. However, there are still notable areas that require improvement. <br><br>
                The main issue we realized from the study is that <span>navigability is made more difficult by ambiguous and confusing features</span>. We observed that for several tasks, many participants were uncertain of how to locate certain items or areas they needed to complete the task.
                So, this is a key area that we need to address and iterate upon as we finalize our product.

                <span>•</span> ensure that the user doesn't have to go through so many <span>steps</span> to complete a task <br>
                <span>•</span> make it more <span>known</span> to a user that they completed a task (i.e. microanimation upon completion) <br>

            <h2>Discover Page</h2>
            <p>Though we had been designing hifis for a while by this point, we <span>struggled</span> to decide on a Discover Page design even after multiple iterations. We wanted to add some type of <span>filter</span> and/or sort feature to allow for better search for desired content for a user, so we had attempted to incorporate those features in several ways. Finally, we narrowed our designs down to <span>2 variations</span> of Discover to accommodate our ideas of filtering content.</p>
            <img src="mon-ami/discover-ab-hifis.png">
            <p>As you can see, <span>Version A</span> has users select a category of the type of content they want, and then filter to their desired content subcategories using a scrollable navigation selection bar, with an individual sort by button and respective popup. <span>Version B</span> includes a navigation bar where the user can select the content category they want, and a separate filter button that includes a sort by feature as well as an option to filter by genre subcategories.</p>
        </section>


        <section>
            <h2>Discover Page A/B Testing</h2>
            <p>Feeling conflicted on which Discover page designs would offer the best search experience for users, we decided to conduct an <span>A/B Usability study</span> just for Discover to evaluate which features of each design would be the most optimal to include in Mon Ami.</p>
            <h4>Goal</h4>
            <p>For this study, we hope to attain feedback and insights from users to identify which content search, filter, and sort design would allow for the most optimal experience for users to find their <span>desired content</span> in Mon Ami's Discover.</p>
            <h4>User Tasks</h4>
            <p>We had our users perform the same tasks on both the Version A and Version B designs, and observed their experiences completing the same tasks on both versions.<br>
            <span>1.</span> Navigate to the podcasts page and find the anxiety subcategory <br>
            <span>2.</span> Sort music by length (shortest to longest)<br>
            <span>3.</span> Search for a specific meditation and like it<br>
            </p>
            <h2>Results</h2>

Our study participants were generally able to follow through with the tasks and understood the purpose of the features we had included. However, there are notable areas that we must address and improve upon.<br> </p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>Where do I even begin? Mon Ami is my first<span> ever UX project</span>, and it was through this project where I found my passion for User Experience Design. I learned so much about the UX process and had so much fun ideating, designing, and iterating on every part of this project. That being said, this project was not without its own <span>obstacles</span>. People came in and out to work on this project, and ultimately it came down to just me and 2 other people to bring this project into completion. This project also took a really long time to complete, as we often struggled to find time to come together as a team to work on it. In addition, we at times spent a lot of time designing and redesigning features based on our own preferences instead of our users' preferences, which did add time to our project timeframe. </p>
                <p>A huge takeway from this project it is important to really <span>consider the users</span> in every aspect of designing. This will give us more insight into our users' wants and needs and allow us to iterate upon our designs so it is more functional and inclusive. In future projects, we aim to conduct multiple usability studies to attain valuable feedback to better our products for our users.</p>

                <h2>What's Next</h2>
                <p>We would love to <span>expand</span> upon Mon Ami's existing features to provide more content options and variety for users. We also would like to continue to <span>brainstorm</span> and incorporate other features that could address users' mental health and offer more support.</p>
