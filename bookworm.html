                <h2>What is Bookworm?</h2>
                <p>Bookworm is a <span>reading platform</span> that fosters habitual reading and connections with other readers. I took on this process to explore the UX design process, improve my design skills, and work on my responsive design skills.

                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>Reading is one of the most valuable activities we can do. Intellectually, it advances our knowledge and emotionally, it allows us to escape reality for some time. However, life can sometimes get in the way and limit our time and motivation to read. It can be difficult to focus wholeheartedly on reading and make a regular commitment to do so. So given these constraints, how can we create a platform that <span>promotes commitment and motivation</span> to reading, while making it an <span>enjoyable experience</span>?

            </div>

                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <p>Bookworm, a reading platform, allows for individuals to set reading <span>goals</span>, <span>connect</span> with like-minded readers, and <span>find books</span> that pique their interests.

                <h2>Usability Test #1</h2>
                <p>Do my designs work? Before moving onto high fidelity designing, I conducted a usability study among 3 people to learn their impressions of the Bookworm platform over mobile, tablet, and web interfaces. 
                </p>
                <p>The main goal of this study was to understand the users’ impressions of the BookWorm platform to iterate upon the platform.</p>
                <h4>User Tasks</h4>
                <p>
                    <span>1.</span> Navigate to the first book on your current reads <br>
                    <span>2.</span> Search a book using a suggested filter and start reading it <br>
                    <span>3.</span> View a discussion and write a comment <br>
                    <span>4.</span> View someone’s profile and add them as a friend <br>
                    <span>5.</span> Add a book to your wishlist from recommended <br>
                </p>
                <h4>Data Collected</h4>
                <p>I documented observations of how the users went through their given tasks, as well as their commentary and questions. I also collected each user’s time on the task, task completion rate amongst the participants, and SEQ rating per task. The users also completed a survey providing feedback post-study. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="full-block">
                <h2>Evaluations</h2>
                <p>I created an affinity diagram to organize observations and feedback that I obtained during the study as well as from the post study survey.</p>
                <img class="brainstorming" src="bookworm/affinity-map.png">  
                <p>Overall, the participants were able to successfully go through most of the tasks. However, there are certainly notable areas of the app that were problematic for the users to navigate through.
                    The main general issue I uncovered, based on participant feedback during and after each task, was where to find features of the app. For example, some of my participants were confused on whether they can find books in the recommended section of home, or if they would only be able to find it in the "search" page.</p>
            </div>   
            <div class="full-block">
                <h4>Potential Solutions</h4>
                <p>Based on my affinity diagram and usability test insights, there are some notable improvements and adjustments to make as I proceed to high fidelity designing: <br><br>
                        <span>•</span> Create general design consistency, such as spaced out text, color scheme, and font sizes <br>
                        <span>•</span> Emphasize goal setting and achieving through clearer indication of goal progress.<br>
                        <span>•</span> Improved filtered search in discovering reads. <br>
                        <span>•</span> Rename/recreate community category to make it clearer that it consists of discussions, friends, book clubs, etc.<br>
                        <span>•</span> Create settings to set notifications and adjust reading preferences<br>

                <p>I created a simpler, but more visual display of a user's progress on their reads and challenges by designing a pie chart instead of a progress bar. This allows for a clearer display of the reader's progress, better indicating how the user has met or not met their goals, with minimal clutter of the chart and text.</p>

                <h2>Filtered Search</h2>
                <p>Instead of including the book filter options on the discover page above the displayed book categories, I decided to only display those search filters once the user clicks to search content. This would allow for the user to more easily view the suggested books content and have an easier method of searching if they are trying to search for more content.</p>

                <p>First, I renamed "Community" to "Connect" to make it more clear that there could be a variety of ways users can connect with others in reading, not only joining a group. Also, instead of landing directly on the friends page once the user navigates to this page, I created another subpage, Trending. This page allows for the user to get a mixture of community related content such as posts, notable groups, friend suggestions, etc, while also letting them view the navigation to other pages: Friends, Discussions and Book Clubs.</p>

                <p>I first designed a general settings page for the app as a whole. I then designed simple individual pages for users to set notifications and reading preferences. The notifications are intended to allow users to create regular habits to read, and the reading preferences allow for users to indicate their preferred content so they can achieve reading recommendations that they are more likely to commit to reading.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Wow, can't believe I'm done... or am I? The biggest thing that I got out of designing Bookworm is that I was able to explore the UX Process in more depth. In doing so I was able to gain more insight into not only the UX design process, but also the overall product development process, which allowed me to design Bookworm in a more user-centric and strategic fashion. From doing so, I gained a better understanding of the uportance of research - both user and market research - in developing any product. In addition, I learned to use a new design tool, Adobe XD! While I still have a lot to learn with using Adobe XD, I enjoyed exploring a new design tool, and hope to explore even more in the future.
                <br><br> I'm most definitely not done with Bookworm! While this is a good stopping point, I would like to conduct another usability test (or several more) and keep innovating new features to make reading a more enjoyable and productive experience. I intend to continually work on making Bookworm increasingly more user centric across a variety of devices.
