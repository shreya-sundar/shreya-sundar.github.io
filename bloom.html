                    <p>Bloom is an <span>online secondhand clothing store</span> that seeks to modernize the thrifting experience to revolutionize and promote sustainable shopping. This project was created during Portfolio 101 by Creative Tech Design Club @ UCSC, led by our president <a href="https://www.yukti-malhan.com" target="_new">Yukti Malhan</a>. </p>

                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>Today, e-commerce dominates and shapes the way individuals shop for items, and clothes are especially commonly shopped for online. However, the experience of online shopping can get quite complicated. From the difficulty of finding desired products, to multistep processes of making a purchase, there are plenty of opportunities to simplify the online shopping experience and make it <span>easier, quicker, and simpler.</span></p>

            <div class="full-block">
                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <p>Bloom, a <span>minimally designed</span> secondhand clothing website, makes it simple to find what a user is looking for, to get the information they require without being overwhelmed, and check out without too many steps.</p>

                <p>Bloom was my <span>first</span> ever completed UX project. As such, it was an <span>incredible learning experience</span> where I explored the UX process and improved on my design skills. I also got to experience working on a project with a team, having previously only designed by myself or with 1-2 others. I experienced balancing <span>team dynamics</span>, managing roles, evaluating each others' work, and gaining insights from other designers' perspectives.</p>

                <h2>What's Next</h2>
                <p>Bloom is most definitely <span>not complete</span>! I would like to conduct a usability test or multiple to gain authentic feedback from users and see how Bloom can be improved. In addition, there are several different pages and components of the website that I want to add and expand upon to deliver to a wider audience. And, I will continually brainstorm and iterate on the designs to simplify users' shopping experience further.</p>
